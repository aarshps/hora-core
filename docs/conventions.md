# Hora family conventions

The shared stack and conventions every Hora app is expected to follow. This is the
single source of truth; when a convention changes, update it here.

## App shape

Each Hora app is a **cross-platform monorepo** with up to three platforms plus a
shared contract folder:

```
<app>/
├── android/    Kotlin + Gradle
├── ios/        SwiftUI + XcodeGen
├── web/        Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
└── shared/
    ├── firebase/   firestore.rules, firebase.json, .firebaserc
    └── domain/     SPEC.md (canonical data model) + golden-vectors.json
```

Each app talks to its **own** Firebase project. The Firestore data model is kept
identical across an app's platforms via that app's `shared/domain/SPEC.md` — field
names, types, and layouts must match across Android/iOS/web.

## Android stack (reference — confirm against the app's `libs.versions.toml`)

As of the most recent family app (Varisankya):

| Component | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Android Gradle Plugin | 9.0.1 |
| Kotlin | 2.3.0 |
| Material | Material 3 Expressive |
| Min/target | Android 15+ |
| Architecture | MVVM |
| Play publishing | `com.github.triplet.play` (gpp) |

Apps pin versions in `android/gradle/libs.versions.toml`. Treat the table above as a
starting reference, not a hard pin — always read the consuming app's catalog.

## Cross-language code sharing

No cross-language code generation. Kotlin/Swift/TypeScript do not share compiled code
(KMP and a shared-TS core are out of scope). Shared **logic** is expressed as a domain
spec + golden test vectors, not generated code. Shared **assets and conventions** live
here in `hora-core`.

## Secrets

Secrets are managed with the **Bitwarden CLI (`bw`)**, never committed. On Windows `bw`
is at `C:\Users\Aarsh\AppData\Roaming\npm\bw.cmd`. `hora-core` is public and must never
contain secrets of any kind.

## Module consumption (to be decided per module)

`hora-core` currently shares documentation and assets, consumed by reference. When the
first shared **code** module is extracted, record its consumption mechanism (git
submodule vs. published artifact) here.
